Total Steps

    Step 1: Importing required libraries
    Step 2: Start webcam and set dimensions
    Step 3: Load background image
    Step 4: Load mode images (screens for each mode)
    Step 5: Load icon images (small images for user selections)
    Step 6: Initialize variables for hand gesture control
    Step 7: Start the main loop
    Step 8: Gesture recognition and selection
    Step 9: Visual selection animation
    Step 10: Pause for 1 second after a selection
    Step 11: Show selected icons at the bottom of the screen
    Step 12: Show the final image on screen

modeType
-------
modeType to keep track of current screen (0, 1, 2)

0	First screen    (step 1)	First image from listImgModes
1	Second screen   (step 2)	Second image from listImgModes
2	Third screen    (step 3)	Third image from listImgModes




selection
---------
When the user shows 1 finger    → selection = 1
When the user shows 2 fingers   → selection = 2
When the user shows 3 fingers   → selection = 3

No selection initially          → selection = -1 




counter
-------
counter is used to measure how long the user holds a specific hand gesture (like 1 finger, 2 fingers, etc.).





selectionSpeed
--------------

selectionSpeed controls how quickly the green ring fills up when a gesture is being held. Once the ring completes a full circle (360 degrees), the gesture is accepted as a selection.
Try with 3, 7,15
